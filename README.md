This Python 3 package provides simple methods for estimating mutual information of continuous and discrete variables.
With one method call, you can estimate several variable pairs and time lags at once.
Both unconditional and conditional MI (including multivariate condition) are supported.
The interface is aimed at practical, non-linear correlation analysis.

The package uses the nearest neighbor methods decscribed in:

## Getting started

This package requires Python 3.7 or higher,
and it is tested to work on the latest versions of Ubuntu, macOS and Windows.
The only hard dependencies are reasonably recent versions of NumPy and SciPy;
Pandas is strongly suggested for more enjoyable data analysis.

This package is available on PyPI:
```sh
pip install ennemi
```
(If your machine has multiple Python installations, you may need to run e.g. `pip3`.)

For documentation, please see https://polsys.github.io/ennemi.


## Building

The tests depend on pandas, so you need that installed in addition.
Additionally, `pytest` and `mypy` are required for building the project.
All of these are installed by the "extras" syntax of `pip`.

To install the package in development mode, clone this repository and execute
```sh
pip install -e .[dev]
```
in the repository root folder.

All methods, including tests, are type annotated and checked with `mypy`.
The CI script runs the check automatically on each pushed commit.
To run the check yourself, execute
```sh
python -m mypy ennemi/ tests/unit tests/integration tests/pandas
```
in the repository root (configuration is stored in `mypy.ini` file).

Please see also the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
