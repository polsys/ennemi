In this tutorial we will go through the various use cases of `ennemi`.
I assume that you know, at basic level, what mutual information means.
Before starting with your own projects, I strongly encourage you to still
read the [chapter on potential issues](potential-issues.md),
lest you want to discover those the hard way!

In all the examples, the method of interest is `ennemi.estimate_mi()`.
The use cases only differ in the input parameters.



## Bivariate normal distribution

We begin by considering a two-variable normal distribution:
$$
(X, Y) \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\mu, \Sigma).
$$
We assume that both $X$ and $Y$Â have unit variance.
The two variables may be correlated with the coefficient $\rho$.
In this case the covariance matrix becomes
$$
\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & \rho\\
\rho & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
There is an explicit formula for the mutual information between the two variables:
$$
\mathrm{MI}(X, Y) = -\frac 1 2 \ln \det \Sigma = -\frac 1 2 \ln (1-\rho^2).
$$

For example, if $\rho = 0.8$, we would expect $\mathrm{MI}(X, Y) \approx 0.51$.
We can test what `ennemi` outputs with the following code:
```python
from ennemi import estimate_mi
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng(1234)
rho = 0.8
cov = np.array([[1, rho], [rho, 1]])

data = rng.multivariate_normal([0, 0], cov, size=800)
x = data[:,0]
y = data[:,1]

print(estimate_mi(y, x))
```

The code prints
```
[[0.51039762]]
```
as would be expected.
The result is in double brackets because `estimate_mi()` always outputs a 2D array.
This will be discussed more below.



## More variables

Let's extend the above example by adding another variable.
As you remember, the mutual information between independent variables is 0.

The `estimate_mi()` method accepts a 2D array, or a list of arrays, for the `x` parameter.
In that case, it splits the array into variables $X_1$ to $X_m$,
and calculates $\mathrm{MI}(X_i, Y)$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, m$.

This interface is a shorter way of calculating the MI between several
$X$ variables and $Y$.
It may also be slightly faster, because `ennemi` computes the estimates
in parallel whenever it is beneficial.
However, this should not be confused with _multivariate mutual information_,
the MI between a set of variables.
As of this writing, `ennemi` does not support computing multivariate MI.

Here's the above example updated with a new, independent variable $Z$:
```python
from ennemi import estimate_mi
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng(1234)
rho = 0.8
cov = np.array([[1, rho], [rho, 1]])

data = rng.multivariate_normal([0, 0], cov, size=800)
x = data[:,0]
y = data[:,1]
z = rng.normal(0, 1, size=800)

print(estimate_mi(y, [x, z]))
```

The code prints
```
[[ 0.51039762]
 [-0.02167661]]
```
The first row gives $\mathrm{MI}(X, Y)$ and the second row $\mathrm{MI}(Z, Y)$.
As expected, the latter is very close to $0$.
Due to random uncertainty and properties of the estimation algorithm,
the result will not be exactly 0, and may even be negative.
(Negative values far from zero, including $-\infty$, are discussed in the chapter
on potential issues.)

Above, we used a list of arrays `[x, z]` as the parameter to `estimate_mi()`.
In a later example we will use a two-dimensional NumPy array instead.



## Time lag

In many systems, variables are coupled with a time lag.
There may be a clear dependence between $Y(t)$ and $X(t-\Delta)$,
whereas the apparent link between $Y(t)$ and $X(t)$ may be weaker or nonexistent.

The time lag is specified by passing an integer or a list/array of integers as
the `lag` parameter to `estimate_mi()`.
The lags are applied to the $X_i$ variables and may be positive or negative
(in which case information flows from $Y$ to $X$ instead).

The $Y$ array is constrained so that it stays the same for all lags.
This is done in order to make the results comparable.
For example, if there are observations $Y(0), \ldots, Y(N-1)$
and the lags are $-1$, $0$ and $1$,
the array $Y(1), \ldots, Y(N-2)$ is compared with
$$
\begin{cases}
X(2), \ldots, X(N-1),\\
X(1), \ldots, X(N-2),\\
X(0), \ldots, X(N-3),
\end{cases}
$$
each in turn.

Let's consider a model where $Y(t) = X(t-1) + \varepsilon$,
and estimate the MI for various time lags:
```python
from ennemi import estimate_mi
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng(1234)
x = rng.gamma(1.0, 1.0, size=400)
y = np.zeros(400)
y[1:] = x[0:-1]
y += rng.normal(0, 0.01, size=400)

print(estimate_mi(y, x, lag=[1, 0, -1]))
```

The code prints:
```
[[ 3.8158148  -0.04623529 -0.00942073]]
```
which means that there is a link between $Y(t)$ and $X(t-1)$, but not
between $Y(t)$ and $X(t)$ or $X(t+1)$.



## Combining the above

In this example, we import the data set from a file using a NumPy method
and pass the imported data straight to `estimate_mi()`.
We calculate the MI for several time lags and plot the results with Matplotlib.

To try this example, download the [mi_example.csv](mi_example.csv) file.

```python
from ennemi import estimate_mi
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# The unpack=True parameter is necessary for the data to have the shape
# expected by estimate_mi().
data = np.loadtxt("mi_example.csv", delimiter=",", skiprows=1, unpack=True)
time_lags = np.arange(-3, 6)

mi = estimate_mi(data[0], data[1:4], lag=time_lags)

plt.plot(time_lags, mi[0,:], label="$x_1$")
plt.plot(time_lags, mi[1,:], label="$x_2$")
plt.plot(time_lags, mi[2,:], label="$x_3$")
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("Time lag (steps)")
plt.ylabel("Mutual information (nats)")
plt.title("Mutual information between $y$ and...")
plt.show() # or plt.savefig(...)
```

![The mutual information for x1 peaks at lag 1, for x2 at lag 3 and for x3 stays near zero.](example_mi_plot.png)

From this plot we can deduce that:
- there is a connection between $Y$ and $X_1$, but only with lag 1,
- and a slightly weaker connection between $Y$ and $X_2$, but only with lag 3,
- and a connection between $Y$ and $X_3$ without any lag.

Finally, the two-dimensionality of the returned `mi` is useful.
The array is indexed as `mi[variable_index, lag_index]`.

A word of warning: in a real time series, where the data is often autocorrelated,
the peaks will not be nearly as sharp.



## Conditional mutual information

Suppose that in our previous example, we know that there is a connection
between $X_1$ and $X_2$.
We may know this from theory, or maybe by running
```python
estimate_mi(data[2], data[1], lag=2)
```
recognizing the high value, and then plotting the two variables.

Now the question is: how much additional information does $X_1$ provide when
$X_2$ is already known?
We get this by calculating the conditional mutual information.

```python
from ennemi import estimate_mi
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

data = np.loadtxt("mi_example.csv", delimiter=",", skiprows=1, unpack=True)
time_lags = np.arange(-3, 6)

mi = estimate_mi(data[0], data[(1, 3),:], lag=time_lags,
                 cond=data[2], cond_lag=2)

plt.plot(time_lags, mi[0,:], label="$x_1$")
plt.plot([], []) # Keep the colors comparable
plt.plot(time_lags, mi[1,:], label="$x_3$")
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("Time lag (steps)")
plt.ylabel("Mutual information (nats)")
plt.title("Conditional mutual information between $y$ and...")
plt.show()
```

![The conditional MI for x1 peaks at lag 1, but x3 has even larger peak at lag 0.](example_cmi_plot.png)

Now we can see that $X_3$ is actually more significant in determining $Y$ than $X_1$!
The dependence between $X_1$ and $X_2$ resulted in $X_1$ "borrowing"
some explanative power from $X_2$.

The example data was generated with
$$
\begin{align*}
X_2(t) &= \mathrm{Normal}(0.2, 4^2),\\
X_1(t) &= X_2(t-2) + \mathrm{Normal}(0, 0.2^2),\\
Y(t) &= X_1(t-1) + \mathrm{Normal}(0, 0.1^2),\\
X_3(t) &= Y(t) - X_2(t-3).
\end{align*}
$$
The reason for our result is that $X_3$ contains the full difference between
$Y$ and $X_2$ whereas there is still some random variation between $X_1$ and $Y$.



## Masking observations

Sometimes, you want to use only a subset of the observations.
This is easy to do with some array slicing unless some variables are time lagged.
The time lags are easy to get the wrong way around, and
if the subset consists of several separate parts,
the resulting array is no longer evenly spaced in time.

To make subsetting with time lags easier, `estimate_mi()` accepts a `mask` parameter.
The mask is an array (or list) of boolean values.
A observation is only used if the corresponding `mask` element is `True`.
Time lags are applied as usual to `x` and `cond` arrays.

Consider a model of two variables.
The first variable has a daily cycle.
The second variable follows the first with a time lag, but gets meaningful
values only in the daytime.

![A cosine curve, and another cosine curve truncated to be positive.](example_mask_plot.png)

To analyze the full data set, you would execute:
```python
from ennemi import estimate_mi
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# One observation every 30 minutes
t = np.arange(4*48) / 2
rng = np.random.default_rng(1234)
x = -0.3 * np.cos(2 * np.pi * t / 24) + rng.normal(0, 0.001, len(t))
y = np.sqrt(np.maximum(0, -np.cos(2 * np.pi * (t-3) / 24))) + rng.normal(0, 0.001, len(t))

print(estimate_mi(y, x, lag=[0, 1, 2, 3]))
```
The result is:
```
[[1.36065339 1.38213486 1.45658645 1.46549623]]
```

To constrain to daytime observations of $Y$ only, replace the last line with
```python
mask = np.logical_and(t % 24 > 6, t % 24 < 18)
print(estimate_mi(y, x, lag=[0, 1, 2, 3], mask=mask))
```
This produces slightly larger MI values:
```
[[1.6303343  1.72073981 1.81418762 1.88527594]]
```
